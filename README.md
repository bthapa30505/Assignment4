This repository contains the follwing 4 files
1) binary_heap.py
   This file contains the source code for maximum heap implementation using the array.
2) heapsort.py
   This file contains the source code for the implementation fo the heap sort.
3) report.pdf
   This PDF file contains the analysis of the heap sort as well the binary heap implementation.
4) README.md
   This file gives the overview of this project.

# Steps to run python files
In order to run the binary heap implemenation and heapsort implemenation, following steps can be performed.
  1) Clone the repository to your local system.
  2) Open the project directory on your terminal
  3 Use the follwing commands to run the python files
    a) python3 binary_heap.py 
    b) python3 heapsory.py    

# Summary 
Overall this project gave good understanding of how heap sort works. I was able to compare the performance of heap sort with other algorithms like merge sort and quick sort. Also I learned the specifics of how heap sort is designed with array. On the other hand I was also able to implement maximum binary heap, which helped me better understand a real life use case of sorting using heap implementation. Along with that, I was able to understand time complexity for insert, remove, modify_priority and isEmpty methods.
